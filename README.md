# PoC: Deploy VMs on Workstation 17.x using Packer + Terraform + Ansible

## Section 0. Choice of Hypervisor: VMware Workstation

This project utilizes VMware Workstation as the virtualization platform for several key reasons aligned with its goals as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) learning tool and local development environment:

### A. Accessibility

Unlike Type-1 hypervisors such as vSphere (ESXi), VMware Workstation runs on standard desktop operating systems such as Linux (preferred) and Windows. This eliminates the need for dedicated server hardware and expensive licensing, lowering the barrier to entry for developers, students, and home lab enthusiasts who wish to replicate this setup.

### B. Developer-Friendly Workflow

Workstation Pro 17 provides an integrated GUI and console access, which is invaluable during the development and debugging of IaC scripts. When an automated process fails, the ability to immediately inspect a VM's state via a familiar interface significantly speeds up troubleshooting compared to managing a remote, headless hypervisor.

### C. Project Scope

The primary objective of this project is to establish an automated Kubernetes deployment for my personal practice in deploying a distributed GitLab Helm service on Kubernetes, which is not to build a production-grade, highly-available cluster. (or maybe someday, who knows?) The features offered by Workstation (e.g., snapshots, simple networking) are perfectly suited for this purpose, while the advanced enterprise features of vSphere are not required. The core automation logic developed here remains largely portable to other platforms.

### D. Comparison with Oracle VirtualBox

Although VirtualBox is a quite good open-source alternative, the choice of VMware Workstation for this project is based on its performance in multi-node environments, its virtualization driver architecture for networking and storage I/O, especially the Paravirtualized network card (VMXNET3) and storage controllers (PVSCSI, NVMe) inherited from the enterprise-grade ESXi product line. This Type 1 Hypervisor-like architecture is well-suited for Kubernetes development and testing work. In comparison, while VirtualBox is a feature-complete, free, and open-source solution suitable for lightweight loads and general purposes, its performance limitations in I/O-intensive multi-node scenarios would affect the stability and responsiveness of the cluster.

### E. Operating System for this Project

This project is currently only implemented on Ubuntu/Debian Linux systems, with Ubuntu Desktop 24 LTS as the operating system. The entry script files are currently written using apt, with support for other Linux distros planned for the future.

## Section 1. Environmental Setup

### Required. VMware Workstation

VMware Workstation Pro 17 is the virtual machine application used in this IaC project. You need to register an account on broadcom.com, then click [here to download Workstation Pro 17](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware%20Workstation%20Pro&freeDownloads=true). **This project requires VMware Workstation 17.6.2 or later installed.**

**Note:**

-  If this is your first time using VMware Workstation, you'll need to open the program and complete the User Agreements. Otherwise, the process will fail immediately in Packer's headless mode. Alternatively, you can open `packer/ubuntu-server-24.pkr.hcl` and change the `headless` parameter to `false`. Alternatively, you can use VNC to view the screen
-  If using Docker for deployment, currently `headless` can only be set to true, mainly due to `libxml2` related issues that are still under investigation; you can also use VNC to view the screen

After installation, configure VMware Network Editor:

-  Open VMware Network Editor (`vmware-netcfg`).
-  Ensure `vmnet8` is set to NAT with subnet `172.16.86.0/24` and DHCP enabled.
-  Ensure `vmnet1` is set to Host-only with subnet `172.16.134.0/24` (no DHCP).

### Option 1. Install on Native: For Debian and Ubuntu

      ```

## Section 2. Configuration

### Step A. Network Configuration

The virtual machines deployed in this project use a dual network mode with the following specifications:

-  NAT Network (`vmnet8`): This network interface provides virtual machines with access to external internet during system installation and subsequent operations. The Subnet is `172.16.86.0/24`
-  Host-only Network (`vmnet1`): This network interface is dedicated for communication between Kubernetes cluster nodes and allows the host system to access internal cluster services. The Subnet is `172.16.134.0/24`

These parameters currently need to be set manually. In the future, these two parameters can be adjusted in the `scripts/config.sh` file.

### Step B. Initial Project Setup

To ensure the project runs smoothly, please follow the procedures below to complete the initialization setup.

0. **Environment variable file:** The script `entry.sh` will automatically create a `.env` environment variable for docker files to use, which can be ignored. This will later be integrated into the HashiCorp Vault workflow (with the following setup).

1. **Switch Environment:** You can switch between "Docker" or "Native" environment by using `./entry.sh` and entering `1`. Please refer to the descriptions in Section 1's Option A or B, and switch to the appropriate mode based on your operating system.

2. **Generate SSH Key:** During the execution of Terraform and Ansible, SSH keys will be used for node access authentication and configuration management. You can generate these by running `./entry.sh` and entering `4` to access the _"Generate SSH Key"_ option. You can enter your desired key name or simply use the default value `id_ed25519_iac_automation`. The generated public and private key pair will be stored in the `~/.ssh` directory

3. **Create Secret Variable Files (Would be further integrated into HashiCorp Vault)**

   During the Packer and Terraform execution process, user-defined variables need to be set up, which requires manually creating the following variable files. For security considerations, these files have already been preconfigured in `.gitignore` and will not be included in version control.

   -  **For Packer:** You can create the `packer/secret.auto.pkrvars.hcl` file using the following command:

      ```bash

      VM_USERNAME="YOUR_VM_USERNAME"
      VM_PASSWORD="YOUR_VM_PASSWORD"
      HASHED_PASSWORD=$(echo -n "$VM_PASSWORD" | mkpasswd -m sha-512 -P 0)

      cat << EOF > packer/secret.auto.pkrvars.hcl
      ssh_username = "$VM_USERNAME"
      ssh_password = "$VM_PASSWORD"
      ssh_password_hash = "$HASHED_PASSWORD"
      ssh_public_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519_iac_automation.pub"
      EOF
      ```

      In which `ssh_username` and `ssh_password` are the account and password used to log into the virtual machine; while `ssh_password_hash` is the hashed password required for virtual machine automatic installation (Cloud-init). This password needs to be generated using the password string from `ssh_password`. For instance, if the password is `HelloWorld@k8s`, then the corresponding password hash should be generated using the following command:

      ```bash
      mkpasswd -m sha-512 HelloWorld@k8s
      ```

      And `ssh_public_key_path`: needs to be changed to the **public key** name generated earlier, the public key will be in `*.pub` format

   -  **For Terraform:** You can create the `terraform/terraform.tfvars` file using the following command with `VM_USERNAME` and `VM_PASSWORD` above:

      ```bash
      cat << EOF > terraform/terraform.tfvars

      vm_username = "$VM_USERNAME"
      vm_password = "$VM_PASSWORD"
      ssh_private_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519_iac_automation"

      # For cluster with single master
      master_ip_list = ["172.16.134.200"]

      # For cluster with high availability
      # master_ip_list = ["172.16.134.200", "172.16.134.201", "172.16.134.202"]

      # Worker nodes
      worker_ip_list = ["172.16.134.210", "172.16.134.211", "172.16.134.212"]

      # Kubernetes network configuration
      k8s_ha_virtual_ip = "172.16.134.250"
      k8s_pod_subnet    = "10.244.0.0/16"
      nat_gateway       = "172.16.86.2"
      nat_subnet_prefix = "172.16.86"
      EOF
      ```

   For users setting up an HA Cluster, the number of elements in `master_ip_list` and `worker_ip_list` determines the number of nodes generated. Ensure the length of `master_ip_list` is an odd number to prevent the etcd Split-Brain risk in Kubernetes. Meanwhile, `worker_ip_list` can be configured based on the number of IPs. The IPs provided by the user must correspond to the host-only network segment.

   **Note:** Please make sure to replace `YOUR_VM_USERNAME` and `YOUR_VM_PASSWORD` with the actual credentials you wish to use. If you specified a non-default key name in the previous step, you must also update the `ssh_public_key_path` and `ssh_private_key_path` fields accordingly

4. **[Deprecated] Set up Ansible Vault**

   > This section would be replaced by **HashiCorp Vault** for more environmental consistency.

   ~~Although Ansible Vault setup is currently mandatory, the related configurations are still being integrated. You need to run `./entry.sh`, enter 3 to access the "Set up Ansible Vault" option. At this point, the terminal will ask you to enter a password to encrypt the Vault, and by default it uses the host user's username as the vault_vm_username variable. The system will prompt whether this is the correct login name. Since some people prefer different virtual machine usernames, if you choose to use a different username, the system will open the vim editor for you to enter it manually. After completing the operation, the following two files will be generated:~~

   1. ~~`vault_pass.txt`: Stores the password used to decrypt the Vault, this file is already included in `.gitignore` by default.~~
   2. ~~`ansible/group_vars/vault.yaml`: This is an encrypted variable file~~

5. The project currently uses Ubuntu 24.04.2, which is categorized by Canonical as an "old-release." If you wish to use a newer virtual machine, it is recommended that you first verify the Ubuntu Server version and checksum.

   -  The latest version is available at <https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases/24.04/release/> ,
   -  The test version of this project is also available at <https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/noble/> .
   -  After selecting your version, please verify the checksum.
      -  For latest Noble version: <https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/SHA256SUMS>
      -  For "Noble-old-release" version: <https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/noble/SHA256SUMS>

6. After completing all the above setup steps, you can use `entry.sh`, enter `6` to access _"Rebuild All"_ to perform automated deployment of the Kubernetes cluster. Based on testing, the current complete deployment of a Kubernetes Cluster takes approximately 21 minutes, with an average time of about 3 minutes to configure each node.

## Section 3. System Architecture

This project employs three tools - Packer, Terraform, and Ansible - using an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach to achieve a fully automated workflow from virtual machine image creation to Kubernetes cluster deployment. The overall architecture follows the principle of Immutable Infrastructure, ensuring that each deployment environment is consistent and predictable.

### Deployment Workflow

The entire automated deployment process is triggered by the sixth option _"Rebuild All"_ in the `./entry.sh` script, with detailed steps shown in the diagram below:

### Toolchain Roles and Responsibilities

1. **Packer + Ansible: Provisioning base Kubernetes Golden Image**

   Packer plays the role of an "image factory" in this project, with its core task being to automate the creation of a standardized virtual machine template (Golden Image) pre-configured with all Kubernetes dependencies. The project uses `packer/ubuntu-server-24.pkr.hcl` as its definition file, with a workflow that includes: automatically downloading the `Ubuntu Server 24.04 ISO` file and completing unattended installation using cloud-init; starting SSH connection and invoking the Ansible Provisioner after installation; executing `ansible/playbooks/00-provision-base-image.yaml` to install necessary components such as `kubelet`, `kubeadm`, `kubectl`, and `CRI-O` (also configure it to use `cgroup` driver); finally shutting down the virtual machine and producing a `*.vmx` format template for Terraform to use. The goal of this phase is to "bake" all infrequently changing software and configurations into the image to reduce the time required for subsequent deployments.

2. **Terraform: The Infrastructure Orchestrator**

   Terraform is responsible for managing the infrastructure lifecycle and serves as the core orchestration component of the entire architecture. Terraform reads the image template produced by Packer and deploys the actual virtual machine cluster in VMware Workstation. The definition files are the .tf files in the terraform/ directory, with the **workflow as follows:**

   -  **Node Deployment (Stage I)**:

      -  Based on `master_ip_list` and `worker_ip_list` defined in `terraform/terraform.tfvars`, Terraform calculates the number of nodes that need to be created.
      -  Using the `vmrun` clone command, it quickly replicates multiple virtual machine instances from the `*.vmx` template created by Packer.
      -  Using `remote-exec`, it executes Shell commands on each node to configure static IP addresses, hostnames, and other network settings.

   -  **Cluster Configuration (Stage II)**:
      -  Once all nodes are ready, Terraform dynamically generates `ansible/inventory.yaml` list file.
      -  Then, Terraform invokes Ansible to execute the `ansible/playbooks/10-provision-cluster.yaml` Playbook to complete the initialization of the Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Ansible: The Configuration Manager**

   This is the twice call for Ansible, serving as the configuration manager at different stages. The project's Playbooks are stored in the `ansible/playbooks/ directory`. In terms of role assignment, Ansible is primarily responsible for cluster initialization (invoked by Terraform), executing the following tasks through the `10-provision-cluster.yaml` Playbook:

   1. Initializing the control plane on the Master node with kubeadm init.
   2. Installing Calico as the CNI network plugin. (This will be integrated to Kubernetes or Helm Provider from HashiCorp official)
   3. Obtaining the join-command from the Master node.
   4. Executing `kubeadm join` on all Worker nodes to join them to the cluster.

## Section 4. Evolution of the Architecture

### Phase 1. Migration from VirtualBox to VMware

The project initially used VirtualBox, but the build process frequently encountered `VBOX_E_INVALID_OBJECT_STATE` errors, and cache pollution in `~/.cache/packer` would lead to undeletable "Ghost Drives," causing UUID conflicts and subsequent build failures. Migrated to VMware Workstation resolves these "wierd" issues. After migration, it’s discovered that VMware dynamically names network interfaces based on PCI slots, causing `e1000` and `vmxnet3` drivers to generate different interface names (such as `ens32` or `ens33`) in different scenarios, which broke the fixed Netplan configuration in Terraform's `remote-exec`. The solution was to add logic in the `remote-exec` script to dynamically detect network interface names, though future adjustments will still be necessary.

### Phase 2. Implementing Cluster Scalability

After achieving stable deployment of a single node, the project focus shifted to clustering. The implementation involved introducing two array variables, `master_ip_list` and `worker_ip_list`, in `terraform.tfvars`. Terraform determines the number of VMs to clone based on the length of these arrays, and dynamically generates the `inventory.yaml` list needed by Ansible from a `*.tftpl` template. Additionally, to facilitate manual login verification, Terraform generates a `~/.ssh/iac-kubeadm-deployment_config` file on the local machine, allowing users to log in without a password using aliases like `ssh k8s-master-00`.

### Phase 3. Shifting Common Settings "Left" to Packer

As the architecture gradually expanded, efficiency issues began to emerge. With every execution of `terraform apply`, Ansible would repeatedly perform the same basic tasks on all nodes: installing specific versions of `kubelet`, CRI-O, configuring `sysctl` kernel parameters, disabling `swap`, and other identical foundational tasks. For these highly repetitive behaviors, the project underwent an architectural adjustment, shifting all these common and static preliminary operations from the Terraform stage "left" to the Packer image creation phase.

This refactoring resulted in Packer producing a Golden Image that serves as a template image already containing all K8s dependencies, while Terraform's responsibility was simplified to purely VM cloning and network configuration, significantly reducing overall deployment time. Since cloning virtual machines would cause duplicate IP addresses for NAT network cards, the design modifies the fourth segment of the IP to match the fourth segment of the hostonly-defined IP. For instance, if the IP defined in the hostonly network card is `172.16.134.101`, then the corresponding NAT IP would be `172.16.86.101`.

### Phase 4. Code Structure Refactoring and SSH Process Automation

The goal of this phase was to resolve code duplication issues. Two major refactorings were implemented:

1. **SSH Process Automation:** To achieve completely hands-free Key-Based authentication, the specified SSH public key is directly "baked" into the `authorized_keys` file of the image during the Packer build phase. The `./entry.sh` script was also enhanced with `generate_ssh_key` helper functionality and `check_ssh_key_exists` preliminary checks. To avoid polluting the user's global `~/.ssh/config`, Terraform now generates a project-specific SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/iac-kubeadm-deployment_config`), and dynamically loads it through `local-exec` by adding a line `Include ~/.ssh/iac-kubeadm-deployment_config` to the global configuration file. This project-specific configuration file is removed during `terraform destroy`, ensuring environment isolation and cleanliness.
2. **Centralization of Terraform Variable Structure:** Previously, both the `vm` and `ansible` submodules within Terraform had their own for loops to process node data, creating logical duplication that stemmed from technical debt incurred during personal refactoring with extensive copy-pasting. This phase centralized all complex variable combination logic for node paths, names, etc., into a unified computation in the root directory's `locals.tf`. Submodules were refactored to receive only the final, pre-assembled `all_nodes` object as input, eliminating duplicate for loops and computation logic within modules. This change created a Single Source of Truth, cutting down complexity for future updates and expansions.

### Phase 5. Configuring the HA Cluster and Parameterization

The primary goal is to achieve HA Cluster deployment by directly adjusting the `master_ip_list`. However, configuring an HA Cluster is significantly more complex than a single master node setup.

1. **Execution Order Trade-offs:**

   Extensive experimentation was conducted to determine the correct order for the following two tasks: **`kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join` commands** and **`haproxy` and `keepalive` configuration**. The initial thought process focused on how to convert a single master node cluster into an HA cluster. However, a more fundamental question arose: "How should an HA Cluster be configured from the very beginning?" Given the architecture of this project, provisioning an HA Cluster only requires changes to the Terraform infrastructure.

   This led to the creation of the `ansible/playbooks/10-provision-cluster.yaml` workflow, which handles `haproxy` and `keepalive` for the HA Cluster and `kubeadm join` for other master nodes. This approach avoids breaking the single master node workflow. The reason for executing `haproxy` and `keepalive` first is that `kubeadm init` requires a stable VIP endpoint (`controlPlaneEndpoint`) to generate cluster certificates, so the Load Balancer must exist before the `init` process.

   The benefit of this is that future users only need to modify `master_ip_list` or related parameters. With correct settings, re-running the `./entry.sh` command will deploy an HA Cluster. The internal Kubernetes facilities can be configured via the `HashiCorp/Kubernetes` provider without the risk of destroying declared resources.

2.  **Parameterization:**

   This was done because many users have variables they wish to change, such as `username` and network settings. Each user has their own preferences, and the goal is to minimally intervene in the user's host settings.

   A further consideration was how to prevent the project from requiring excessive variables to be set in multiple locations. Since the project is already automated, it is fundamental that a user should be able to configure the entire project by declaring variables in a single SSoT (Single Source of Truth) block.

   Therefore, after organizing the parameters, they can be integrated into HashiCorp Vault. Another reason for choosing HashiCorp Vault over Ansible Vault is that this project is intended to be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline. The underlying reason is that handling static encrypted files like those in Ansible Vault is cumbersome in CI/CD, as it requires managing a separate decryption key. By integrating with HashiCorp Vault and using the variable passing mechanism, only one setup process is needed.

### Phase 6. Handling Network and Concurrent Process-Triggered Race Conditions

(To be continued)
